## About Qore programming language

Qore is an [open source](https://github.com/qorelanguage/qore) weakly-typed programming language with optional strong
typing and procedural and object-oriented features designed for anything from quick scripting to complex multithreaded,
network-aware application development. Qore is also thread-safe, has garbage collector and its syntax is similar to
those of C++ or Java but also finds inspiration in other languages.
